This video is partly correct but misses a couple of crucial points. The EU has been meddling in Ukraine for years and this has aggravated Russia. This didn't get a mention here. But more importantly, natural gas was found off Crimea in the Black Sea a while back. Shell was drilling for it in 2014 when Russia took the territory from Ukraine. They seized Shell's equipment and are using it right now to drill. That's why they built a $4Bn bridge linking it to the mainland and are now attempting to ling up captured territory in south of Ukraine through Mariupol. There are also massive shale gas deposits in the eastern Donbas region. Putin doesn't want Ukraine as a direct competitor on its doorstep supplying the West with energy as that could well cripple Russia's economy. There's much more to this than 'rescuing' poor ethnic Russians, and much more than historical ties, both of which are nothing more than a fig leaf.

Question: Why does Ukraine want to join NATO, is it only now or did they want to join before the invasion?

That was a pretty unbiased explanation. One thing I think is important is that a gigantic oil and gas reserve has been discovered several years ago, and Ukraine finally has had a US company developing it. This deposit will make Ukraine amongst the biggest natural gas exporters in the world, directly rivaling Russia‚Äôs majority stake in supplying Europe with natural gas. THE OIL and GAS deposits are in the Ukrainian economic exclusion ZONE off the COAST OF CRIMEA, and. the lands of EASTERN UKRAINE!!!!

Nice informative summary. What makes it different is that they are neighboring countries which have assisted each other. Can you be sure that there isn't a feeling of unresolved financial debt. There separation must be mutual and not impose any threat on Russia which is obviously not happening.

It is a comprehensive summary for the Ukraine-Russia conflict. However, Do not compare it with the Philippine-Spain history. Ukraine and Russia were basically one in history and once shared the same heritage and ancestry. Whereas Spain literally colonized, killed and enslaved Filipinos in history, we never shared the same blood in the beginning.

I would suggest only one but very important correction... 9th-century country was called Rus, not Kievan Rus. ""Kievan"" was introduced only at the end of 18th century to identify a period when Kiev was a capital. This is an important fact for those who think that Ukrainians and Russians were two different nations from the get-go...

The only reason for which Putin invaded Ukraine is to keep the throne. The joining of the Crimea was perceived positively by russian society. Of course, finally Russia arrived as well as the United States, that is, as a strong country. He hoped that the war with Ukraine would also be supported, but he was mistaken. Russian society has negatively reacted to this context war, so now the repressive apparatus against citizens is unwinding in Russia.

Putin took action when Ukraine became interested in becoming a NATO member. If Ukraine becomes a NATO member, what will stop USA from stationing missiles in the Ukraine-Russia border. There was a time when USA was willing to engage Russia in an all out war during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The historical facts maybe accurate but the real big reason why Putin decided to invade Ukraine was not discussed or was intentionally avoided.

Why Russia wants Ukraine is like saying why India wants Varanasi. Ukraine is a Soviet construct, not a product of a revolution like other countries. It includes the east part which is the cradle of Russian civilization with people who feel more Russian than Ukrainian and see Ukraine as a part of Russia, and the west part, which was part of Poland and Austria and even collaborated with the Nazis to fight Russia. Ukraine means margin (of Russia). When a Russian says I'm going to Ukraine, he says I'm going to the extreme part of Russia.

However I believe Russia invaded the Ukraine to completely own the new oil deposits found in the Black Sea that is estimated to be the fourth largest deposit in the world. Plus natural gas deposits on the left and right of the country, which if tapped and sold to Europe would bankrupt Russia. (30% GDP is from oil and natural gas exports)

The Rus were Viking tribes that settled in Kiev as far back as 750 AD, 400 years before Moskva existed. Moskva were Finnish Urgic Tribes; Mosk means cow and Va water, which are Finnish names. There is no RUS there. The ethnic background of Moskva is Finnish- Urgic and Mongolian. The Rus developed the religion, city Kiev, alphabet, and had its saints. They spread Kievian culture  much like the Greeks Hellenized the known world, or like the British anglicized the world by the English language. This process does not make Moskva to become RUS in as much as Persian are not Greek. How we are misled by a name; Russia. The capitol of the RUS has always been Kiev. There is no other RUS and no RUS in Moskva. Many say Ukraine began recently; but the culture of the RUS is Kievian RUS, both culture and ethnic background. Ukraine is a name given by Poland meaning outer lands. The lands of the RUS before the Mongolian invasion was very large. The name RUS is a Norse name which means men that row; there are no men that row in Moskva. So Moskva adopted the name Russia while being a Mongolian vassal, essentially traitor to the RUS; and all the czars were Mongolian-Finnish. The Culture  of the Mongolian was centralized power, and that was passed on to present day Russia. Ukraine‚Äôs real name should be Kievian RUS, or Kievskarus!

Some bias detected otherwise a good explanation. At 7:27, Britain and Spain's past imperialism comparison to the existing Russia-Ukraine conflict seem a little off. These nations colonize the OTHER side of the world while Russia-Ukraine are close in proximity, and have parallel culture and history together. 30% Ukrainians speak Russian. Not quite an equal comparison. Regardless, hope both nations will seek peace and respect each other's sovereignty. No to War and No to Suffering

There is currently no war between Russia and Ukraine, but in the tensions in the United States has won the interests, Russia and Ukraine's war, is actually a Russia didn't want to fight, Europe also don't want to intervene in military conflict, but the use of public opinion force both sides fight on the battlefield of war, the United States first release some voice said ahead of Ukraine to join NATO, Forced Russia's military build-up in the border, with Russia's military build-up as an excuse to make ""going to invade Russia Ukraine"" of public opinion, said European countries and pushed reform, the worst thing is the United States also declared himself will not send troops to Ukraine, the artificial up between Russia and Ukraine war are significant benefits to the United States, The war will unnerve Investors in Europe, supporting demand for the dollar as a haven. That means if Europe goes to war, European investors will have to find a way to pull their money out of European financial markets and put it somewhere safe. So where is the safest place? China is the safest, but the Chinese financial market is not open to hot money, so the hot money escaping from Europe will flow into the US capital market. Actually because of the tension between Russia and Ukraine, the world's major currency exchange rate for dollars is on the rise, the dollar will become more strong more valuable, it can alleviate the current society's two major crisis in the United States, the first problem of inflation, life necessities, followed by the U.S. government debt issue has very high debt, by printing money to maintain social stability, The massive inflow of hot money from Europe can replace the Fed and pump money into the financial markets before the market collapses. The CURRENT INFLATION rate in the US is 7.5% and the 10-year Treasury yield is 1.5% to 2%. Who is going to buy us Treasury bonds at a loss? As long as the rest of the world is not safe and investors face the risk of losing their money in Europe, they can only be tricked into buying US Treasury bonds. This is a disguised means of transferring domestic conflicts to the outside world. Russia must not fall into the trap of the US at present, so the US plot to attack the European financial market will not succeed.

Russian military exercises are carried out on its territory, of its state. This has nothing to do with whether Russia, the US or another country likes it or not, but rather with exercising international law and reason. For example, the United States in the 1980s

from his own Congress, he came out to publicly acknowledge in various reports his interference in coups, political and social destabilization, and a long list of economic boycotts that led to civic dictatorships.

Ukraine keeps talking about how they have the choice to join NATO, meanwhile does any of the NATO members have a say in the matter?  US voters and Congress have NEVER had a say about expanding, or even continuing, membership in the organization.  Relationships are more important than treaties, good relationships promote prosperity and avoid conflict, treaties enrich bureaucrats and make large scale war inevitable.  Either end NATO or don‚Äôt continue to endlessly expand NATO forever with zero accountability or even real purpose in 21st century.  Russia is doing this because of NATO and they should accept their role in escalating the severity of the situation.

Sure you'll have to explain to the people of Ukraine that you're just changing owners by switching to the West. Now your independence is even more of a fiction cause you're a 100% dependent on NATO and the EU and if you become part of these organizations you'll find it very hard to stick to their standards.

Germany has made itself dependent from the pipeline Russian gas, which is much cheaper than the liquefied gas that the US exports to its allies by ships. Therefore is understandable that Germany doesn't take part in any military action in Ucraine against Russia.

The UK are flying arms to Ukraine so that they have some defenses. But aircraft are having to detour around German airspace for fear of interception by the Luftwaffe. Thus, Germany seems to be tacitly supporting Russia. With friends like this, who needs enemies eh?

People will feel threatened. They will take sides. They will believe others who take sides. When people are governed by fear, they take sides. When people are governed by anger or resentment, they take sides blindly, foolishly. They will be told who the enemy is, and they will believe what they are told. It will be a great trial for humanity. A trial is a test as well as a proving ground for what is true, what is just and what is honest.

Now that i seen this video fron 1 month ago, i understand that it is not only that russia dont accept ukraine terms or negotiation on keeping peace. But is that ukraine insisting in keeping its stance on applying for nato and eu membership. The confidence that ukraine have is because some backdoor diplomacy and support both from goverment and organization from the western world. But with some underlying catch that the goverment must have some support from the people as shown from western delayed reaction. In my opinion, if i were a president, i would see that was a huge national risk without doubt. Give a ukraine his freedom to choose will give a predictable/certain outcome. Like people in such power and knowledge wouldnt just change its mind in weeks or less without us giving consideration. So the war will be inevitable till one or both side back down. And thats exactly what happen 1 month after this video.

German/Hungarian/Romanian here, I study IR (Masters degree). Really enjoyed the interview, Frau Stelzenm√ºller seems like a smart woman and the reporter asks the right questions.
Nevertheless, I think there is a simple answer to the question in the title, that on the other hand nobody wants to hear: Leave Ukraine as a buffer state between NATO/EU and Russia. The Bucharest summit of 2008 and the published communiqu√© ""Georgia and Ukraine will become part of NATO"" was a big mistake. Georgia got run down half a year later, nobody helped them. Now it¬¥s Ukraine¬¥s turn and again, nobody will shed blood for them.

So, many people are scared and worried about how to sustain life in the world. It says in Isaiah 13: 6-8 and 11 (BSP). ""The day of the Lord is near, it is coming as a destruction from the Almighty."" It was the day of God's judgment on the wickedness of the people. Therefore, what is happening in the world today is a sign that its end or the Day of Judgment is near. And because of what is happening, people are weak, discouraged, and overwhelmed with fear.

And it feels like they are ok with pushing it till Berlin wall turns into Chinese wall. Russia is not USSR, not even close in any way except for nukes. Meanwhile US are still the same. Same culture, same doctrine, same methods. The Berlin wall will fall when Europe will choose to build its own walls. I hope it will happen soon enough before US puts autonomous weapon systems in the middle of Europe.

Ukraine's entry into NATO could be exchanged for Ukraine's entry into the European Union, which is a peaceful entity, and less threatening than NATO along the Russian border. That way Kiev can prosper. Contrary to what the Russians believe, it is convenient for Russia to have a border with the European Union. That produces a lot of prosperity. But Russians in Ukraine should have rights in a Ukrainian constitution. It seems incredible that ten thousand advisers are not able to agree on this to avoid a war.

Ukraine should divide peacefully. Donbass region voted in 2014 to be independent and certainly not fall under NATO. The rest of the country apparently is pro-West.
What's the problem? It's been done before, such as with Kosovo. 
Why must ALL of Ukraine be under NATO when clearly Donbass is against. This will always cause tensions.

Ukraine is acting as if the Minsk agreement protocol was never signed in 2014. And no politicians in the west seem to understand that Russia is not interested to engage in diplomatic negotiations when they have no guarantee that the other parties will abide to their obligations.

I have a question that I am wondering why no journalist is asking. Ukraine's GNP is highly dependent on Russian economy. Who will import these products in case of total breakdown in their relationship? I suppose not EU . Moreover, if Ukraine joins EU, 40 (!) millions of Ukrainians will try to move westwards. Who will give them jobs? EU? States That were closing the borders to immigrants some years ago (Poland, Slovakia, Czechia etc)? That face high unemployment and inflation problems?

How about this for a solution - 
Ukraine doesn't join Nato, Russia gives back the occupied land and they stay away from the Ukraines borders. BUT If Russia does attack Ukraine, then NATO helps to defend Ukraine as if it were an ally. In other words, if Russia doesn't do anything, no military escalation will happen over Ukraine. The drawback would be that Ukraine won't be an ""official"" member of NATO, but unofficially we would still help them if a war broke out.

Glad I don't have small kids to live through this mess. In the meantime we let billionaires double their wealth that they couldn't spend in hundred lives.

Why are you guys dumb in your analysis? Have you tried to deescalate the situation and Russia keeps doing what she does? What Russia wants is its security, it doesn't want to be surrounded by perceived enemies, just as Israel doesn't want to and the US won't want to.
I'd want Russia to install nuclear weapons in Cuba and Venezuela and watch the US reaction, not that I want it, but when Russia's concerns are being twisted makes me wonder what type of journalists you guys are. Ukraine is sovereign and its territorial integrity must be respected by both Russia and its handlers, Ukraine must not allow itself to be used.

THE PERFECT STORM ‚Äì According to Sun Tzu, ‚ÄúIn the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.‚Äù I am not a military or war strategist but this is a perfect storm for Russia to invade Ukraine; I will call this the East and West War. Why, you might say?  The west war is already brewing and manifest on January 6th in this country and it might escalate to a civil war with the help of Russia.  I will not imagine this idea came from within but aids from within to accomplish victory.  If a civil war does breaks out, the current chaos and investigation will be delay or ignore because it will be impossible to fight two wars when the enemy is inside the camp.  All the blames will be for this current administration and this chaos will be fuels to flame a patriotic inside war.  As a result, Russia will win and US will be thrown out of respect and power among nations and January 6th will become the national holiday of Patriotism.  Speed is the essence to win both of these wars but clean up the camp first before it is too late.  ~ Hue Vang

Surely we should also ask whether Europe, and NATO in particular, is also acting as if the Berlin wall didn't fall. Those two political powers want to treat Russia as an enemy with no rhetoric being too much in pursuit of this aim. The ""territorial integrity of Ukraine"" must mean that they intend to take back Crimea, that is now part of Russia, and the two provinces that want to be part of Russia. That is not realistic. There is too much at stake. Call a halt to the troubles. If the people of those regions don't want to be part of Ukraine, let them go!

There is no conflict between Russia and Ukraine. There is a conflict between Donbass Republics and Ukraine. Russia supports Donbass, as a major part of them are ethnically Russian and have Russian citizenship, too. The West pretends, that negotiations between Russia and USA (NATO) is about Ukraine, but in fact the main point of negotiations is different, and that is - expansion of NATO to the East, which cause a military threat to Russia. Ukraine is only a convenient tool to create chaos on the Russian border and to use Ukrainian territory so that to build NATO military bases and deploy strategic weapons close to Russian capital Moscow and other cities. Poor Ukrainians are hostages of the puppets (Poroshenko, Zelenski) brought to power by the West in 2014 after coup d'etat in Kiev. But as one of the French kings used to say - every people deserve their leaders.

difference between ""looking dangerous"" and ""being dangerous"".Russia describes military doctrine as defensive military doctrine. With regard to nuclear weapons specifically, Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons: in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies,in case of aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened.

I don't understand why Russia and the West can't get along and work together to each others mutual benefit, instead of constantly being hostile, and simulating nuclear attacks on each other. There is more benefit for both sides by being freinds than enemies. It seems to be some sort of unofficial rule that both sides have to be hostile to each other. It's a crazy way to deal with each other and it is so sad.

Invite Russia into Nato? If they decline they can't claim we didn't address their issues and offer a decent solution. If accepted, well that would change the world overnight and both sides would have their security guarantees resolved. Regardless, we in the west really REALLY need to address Russia's concerns - I don't think they are unreasonable concerns from their security perspective, even if they are going about trying to get them acknowledged in an unreasonable and unacceptable way.

This lady looks anemic.  Anyway, why wouldn't Ukranians want to become members of NATO?   It's as if you were asking a bunch of abused workers, to join a union; you will definitely get a large percentage to join and fight back.  I was a steward for a Union, and I saw how the union protected employees, and how employees sometimes got away with things.  I'm not used to lying, and so that was one reason I quit being a Stewardess.  I'm glad I'm of there, but you do learn a lot from being a steward, and I do ask that if it's possible, that you join a union, so you can learn the ropes of how it functions; how they often sleep with the enemy, and how they benefit the employees.

Empirical truth still means something, even though it has its limits.  You can tell how the structure of government works by how it trickles down into the culture and beliefs of the people there.  This exercise makes America look ugly as sin, a real monster at times....how does it reflect on Russia?  I've been to Russia, it has a different kind of ugliness, their people are not treated well, their culture is proud but downtrodden...you can see it in the faces of the people.  ""Might is right"" is a more stark truth than anything the west sees on any regular basis.  The free media is put under the boot, if not shut down, political rivalry is suppressed or attacked directly, etc... Always exceptions, but we're talking about the pattern over hundreds of thousands.  The more directly capitalist West is far from any semblance of perfection, everyone drowning in cheap toys but essentially vacant and culturally shallow to the point reality is only what's been on the screen the last 6 months.  The USA in particular has pushed their power to destroy lives in the name of their agenda.... This is not two sides of the same coin though, take stock and see which system would result in truth vs manufactured lies....they both use manufactured world-views, but which is more self-correcting to faults or flat thinking? The ability to detect a slanted view is when they will project a bright light on their enemy, but deny the fault of their own side, a binary coin-like behavior indicative of a flattened world-view.  We know each and every one of us is not innocent, but we nail our enemy to the wall of perfection and they fall short.  To nail your own culture and beliefs to the wall, that is where the truth sits.  So ask your Russian-aligned chat partner to criticize the Russians with as much honesty as they do the various sins of the West.

If someone had stood up to Khrushchev when he wanted to transfer Crimean administrative province to Ukrainian republic for shambolic reasons as pointed out by the declassified documents there wouldn't have been need for a discussion of Crimea today and that's why regardless of the association, organization, union or even country you belong to never allow what is yours to be used as a show of solidarity or unity because nothing last forever countries, unions, organizations, associations or groups alike, Nikita Khrushchev was playing a long game but the Russian people should have been sceptical about what his motives were given that his part of the Soviet state was rebellious by joining forces with the Nazis during their invasion of the Soviet union so this reason alone should have given Russian's a reason to be sceptical about the Ukrainian leadership of the Soviet union but Russian's remained irresponsive towards the attitude of Nikita Khrushchev leading to history repeating itself, Ukrainian support of the Nazis who came to occupy their lands by force and now Ukrainian ambition of joining an alliance which has openly treated Russia as an enemy so my understanding tells me that the Ukrainians are anti Russian's and have been like that for a long time but kept quiet all this while because the gained considerably from attaching themselves to the Russian system so each time the Russian's realigned themselves to look more inwards that anti Russian sentiment resurfaces itself and I would conclude by saying that Russia should go back and look at their history books tracing each step of their relationship with this Ukrainian people to understand the real meaning of their brotherhood as the call it.

If every sovereign country has the right to decide its path, then why does the US feel threatened by Iran having a relationship with Venezuela which is much further than the US shores than Ukraine is from Russia Motherland? Then Why Turkey, Qatar, UAE can not purchase Russian Air defense systems to defend their airspace? Lecturing others in name of democracy but doing the opposite itself does not make the world a safer place. Ukraine does not need to join NATO, but NATO encourages them by the promise of money, trade, and loans to lure them into their sphere of influence. In an ideal world, no arrogant power will claim other countries as its backyard but the US has no moral authority to lecture Russia when itself talk about safeguarding its interest in the Persian Gulf which is 12000 km away from its shores but trying to deny Iran to protect its interests in the Persian Gulf where they have lived for more than 5000 years.

I won‚Äôt get into an ethical dilemma, I couldn‚Äôt care less about which side I support, I just will say this:
It is easy for men which seldom have seen the powers of war, to order about the troops at their command and order them into combat, and paraphrasing Bismarck ‚Äúhe who has glimpsed a dying soldier‚Äôs eyes, will think twice before starting a war‚Äù. This is regardless of whether the Russian president orders an attack, or wether the Ukrainian president orders a recapture of Crimea and the Donbas, or even if the president of the United States orders an all out attack. War is the last resort at the hands of a statesman, and its use is either the result of idiocy or the result of being desperate, both to be avoided by the prudent and the wise, I expect better out of them.

The Holodomor ('to kill by starvation'), also known as the Terror-Famine or the Great Famine, was a famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. It was a large part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933. The term Holodomor emphasises the famine's man-made and allegedly intentional aspects such as rejection of outside aid, confiscation of all household foodstuffs and restriction of population movement. As part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933 which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country, millions of inhabitants of Ukraine, the majority of whom were ethnic Ukrainians, died of starvation in a peacetime catastrophe unprecedented in the history of Ukraine.  Since 2006, the Holodomor has been recognized by Ukraine and 15 other countries as a genocide of the Ukrainian people carried out by the Soviet government.

I live in the US today, immigrated from one of the former eastern block countries many years ago. There is no such thing as 'innocent Ukranians'. Our country once opened to border to any Ukrainians to visit but soon crime rate climbed to unheard levels and most crimes were commited to Ukranians in our country the situation became so bad that my country had to enforce visa again to Ukraine (the only country on the entire world). I still have friends who live close to the Ukrainian border, some work in environmental agencies, each year they have to clean HUNDREDS OF TONS of garbage coming over the border on the rivers from Ukraine. They even sent people over to see and video tape what is happening and these people are dumping garbage into the river or on the banks of rivers including in nature preserves (!) which then wash into the rivers when water level rises. They were even caught doing it in the nature reserve and asked on camera why they do it, they just said they don't care and even the parks don't care, some even had permission from the parks to do it - we have the videos! Why people think Ukraine is a European country but the European Union will not admit them? They are corrupt and completely careless .. so no one cares if the Russians invade them.

difference between ""looking dangerous"" and ""being dangerous"".Russia describes military doctrine as defensive military doctrine. With regard to nuclear weapons specifically, Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons: in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies,in case of aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened.

Why does Russia want to capture more of Ukrainian soil since they captured krimea region which is a port in warm waters ( after all that‚Äôs what they really wanted). The next logical claim would be to capture soil in Bosporus straights but instead they go for more Ukrainian soil. What is that we don‚Äôt see?

If Russia invade Ukraine,  then Nato can give green light to Azerbaijan to invade Armenia and in that case Turkey that is a member of Nato can reach to the caspian see,  exactly on the south of Russia and then Nato can open another frontier with Russia if they decide to invade Ukraine

Why does Putin refuse to meet with the Dutch MH17 crash investigation board when he says he has proof that Russia did not shoot down that aircraft? Seems he would show more courage seeing that he expects his soldiers to die in Ukraine for his beliefs.

I won‚Äôt get into an ethical dilemma, I couldn‚Äôt care less about which side I support, I just will say this:
It is easy for men which seldom have seen the powers of war, to order about the troops at their command and order them into combat, and paraphrasing Bismarck ‚Äúhe who has glimpsed a dying soldier‚Äôs eyes, will think twice before starting a war‚Äù. This is regardless of whether the Russian president orders an attack, or wether the Ukrainian president orders a recapture of Crimea and the Donbas, or even if the president of the United States orders an all out attack. War is the last resort at the hands of a statesman, and its use is either the result of idiocy or the result of being desperate, both to be avoided by the prudent and the wise, I expect better out of them.

A letter to Putin, ""Why It Is Very Stupid to Occupy Ukraine ?""  I am not sure what sort of information you have obtained, from your intelligence agencies,  however  I would like to remind you that a very small issue can alter the whole situation.  You may have had accessed very sensitive information at various  US and NATO defense agencies, about their military strength, however a very small undiscovered secret can alter the result of the  war in Ukraine. For example,   you may have plans to inactivate the efficiency/ functionality  of weapons, like the Stinger or antitank missiles,  but  the west have the technical capacity to find very quick solutions , which may end up  with lakes of Russian  blood . Your weapons have been tested in Syria against naive militias who do not have technical abilities.  Besides that, do you think that the US have not collected  enough information about your new weapons, and thought of methods to respond to them .  I believe that  any miscalculation could lead to a  retaliation using strategic weapons which will eventually destroy every body. I also would like to remind you of the defects of the so called  ""group think"". Remember the mistakes made by  Kennedy's  team in Cuba, and  Bush's team in Iraq, and your country adventure in Afghanistan . The apparent weakness of Biden should not mislead you about the strength of the USA  and  its potential.

difference between ""looking dangerous"" and ""being dangerous"".Russia describes military doctrine as defensive military doctrine. With regard to nuclear weapons specifically, Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons: in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies,in case of aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened.

Perhaps this is why joint development of advanced weapons with Russia has such a dismal record, it is not in Russia's interest for Indians to be able to produce their own arms and Russia has sabotaged these ""efforts"".

After so many year, even I know now China India are not so friendly as before, but I believe they will find an exit in a more peaceful way, as India and Chinese both are peaceful and clever people in their blood.

Millions of Indian live in European not in Russia, And Russia and China are dictatorship where as India is Democracy, I don‚Äôt understand Why Democracy stand with Russia? And Indian should stop Russia weapons . How long will it depend? Now India should focus on self made weapons like Israel üáÆüá±. This war clearly show that Russian weapons are not stronger then American weapons. Now like big country India should focus more in personnel weapon so that we don‚Äôt depend any country. European or Russia both India cannot be under depending any country.

The problem originates from the ambition of both sides. NATO also has expanded when it was just supposed to exist during communism. But of course , the western countries are always taking decisions (ex.when invading Irak) with the consent of no other country but when it is the opposite side doing a geopolitical move then it is wrong. Both are acting with ambition and as always we the population are the ones suffering the most while the ""doctrines"" stay safe.

Putin is like a master chess player. He already knows his next step and all possible outcomes. He's been president for over 20 years. Never underestimate him. Zelenskyy is not a career politician.

Thanks for this documentary, DW! Good work. One note, so-called 'separatists' (in fact, terrorists) in Donbas WOULD NEVER occupy the territory WITHOUT Russians. Fact, Russia was bringing Russian citizens AND weapon in Donbas during all beginning of the 2014. The same 'guests' from Russia came to Kharkiv in 2014 to create massacre against the Euro activists. Literally, there was Russian state-guided terrorism. Which in the end, led to war in Donbas. Hopefully, now many ppl will understand there is only ONE problem in Europe ‚Äì it's Russian invasion to the peaceful country Ukraine, occupation, blackmailing and desire to kill and bring war! BAN RUSSIA from everywhere, ALL organisations, ALL connections. I call to everyone to isolate this psychopath beast! WE NEED TO ACT NOW!

Lovely and very informative. Perhaps you can do Part 3- how they used to cooperate before during USSR and after. For example at the border- in trade and economy,, cooperation between industries, selling agricultural products, education, medical matters. I also heard some Russians married Ukranians and vice versa. It was two countries joined at the hip. During the USSR i noted that most of the medals in the Oympics were won by Ukraine but they were listed under USSR as they were in the union. Its a pity Europe has a union called EU  but the union of USSR has been split up.

I hope and pray Ukraines military has a strategic plan. Ukrainians are a tough people but fighting this war as a conventional head to head conflict will only decimate thier forces.  They should def be hitting Russian tank columns as much as possible but should hold back thier best for an insurgency and counter attack as soon as Russian troops start thinking they won. Make it hell for them. It's already an extremely unpopular move with the Russian people now, and will likely get much worse when countless families start having to bury their children back in Russia, all because their president is a egomaniacal wanna be tough guy. I hope the Russian people finally decide enough is enough and oust Putin. I hate that Russia and America have to see each other as enemies just because 1 man is nestalgic for those good ol days during the cold war when everything was perfect somehow. I don't get it? We humans always think the grass is greener, or used to be in this case, but it never is. A shitload of America is guilty of the same thing, always looking back to those good ol days that never existed.

He made mistakes from his first trip to Brussels..it exposed his intentions. Anyway, in my view, he has made many political mistakes..no wonder war has come to Ukraine. Ukraine has to balance many things amongst NATO members (Esp France and Germany), Russia, and the USA in order to survive. All in all, it must be ""neutral"" - Kissinger and many other honest leaders in the west have advised it so.

I am a United States born part Ukrainian (from my mother‚Äôs side  ) woman who has done her research, and you are failing to mention the United States meddling in this election, and the evidence that proves it was a coup d‚Äô√©tat, to take out a democratically elected president, and replace him with an actor (which is United States tactics all the way), who less than a year before had no political experience (as you mentioned) & was playing the role of the president on a show!!!!!!! There is a lead to phone call with US officials debating who they will put in the role of president and they mentioned Klitschko, who they said it would not be good for the job, and ultimately picked this guy!!!!!!

Putin displaying the Russian Imperial standard for his speeches  - see time stamp 8:07 - that was used by the Czars is a pretty blatant message to everyone what his intentions + machinations are.  Unlike modern day flags, the Imperial Standard represented the Czars, the absolute ruler of the Russian Empire, not the country, the state, or the people.  Putin sees himself as Emperor of Russia & Ukraine.  :(

Imagine running on an anti-corruption ticket just to meet the shady, criminal threats of trump. And now we see what the two men are made of-one is bravely sticking around and fighting alongside his countrymen, the other didn‚Äôt even show up to his own insurrection.

First, I condemn Russia in this war and the brutality on citizens, building and their way of life. Now, I offer my views. This comedian-president is much praised for a stupid bravery where he is only a sacrificial lamb. The first job of a president is to safeguard the lives of his people and he miserably failed. His country is in the safety zone of Russia and Russia simply could not have tolerated it joining Nato. NATO has given him and would give him nothing and he destroyed his country, remember Georgia in 2008? Russia beat up Georgia and US watched it even though US instigated it. In Iraq war, US prompted Kurds and when they started the rebellion, US did not help them, and Saddam slaughtered them. US left Afghanistan and its government helpless recently. Russia tolerated some 12 countries joining NATO and now it was enough for enough for Putin to draw the line. Half of his country was gone, Crimea was gone, and this idiot knew about the invasion. How come he did not denounce joining NATO? This was height of stupidity and I have no sympathy for this comical idiot and I would shed any tear for his stupidity or bravery. Now, NATO is enjoying from the sidelines this magic show.

By sayiny this, I don't mean to justify Putin's action in Ukraine, but I can see that the Ukranian President's lack of experience plays big role here in this conflict & war.

This story has 2 sides and Germany knows better!  Neglected is Russia's fears of invasion that led to 27 million dead in living memory... At the 1991 collapse of the of the USSR, the independence of Ukraine was sudden and not carefully negotiated. Is this a job for NATO or an opportunity to exploit the situation? This is a family matter between Ukraine and Russia. There are factions within the Pentagon that view Ukraine as the key to dismantling the Russian state. Do the principal US strategists know the history of this area? Putin or no Putin, the Russians people would mobilize in what would be a largely unnecessary and fateful war for the US...

The Western politicians and super rich who pull their strings, in their respective countries, want economic dominance at the cost of others and still have imperialistic DNA. Like India was robbed in the past and never compensated but further exploited under the garb of aid, such practices continue with other militarily  weak   countries. Much is made of independence of countries in Europe but there is no care in the world for the rights over the sacred lands of those in Africa, the Middle-East and many other such powerless people.  Wasn't India broken up to weaken its stable structure, while causing untold misery to innocent civilians. Where is retribution for these crimes on the humanity of the weak?  Manipulation of currency values claiming market forces are operating, is an easy way for them to impose financial dominance. All this will stop if there is a multi-polar world where fairness and justice is delivered by the world bodies that falsely claim to be doing this.

This guy was installed by the United States in a 2014 coup. Under his leadership, the people of eastern Ukraine have been continually bombed and shelled. The Azov battalion, a group of literal neo-nazis, are a significant part of this guy's military who has been bombing the people of eastern Ukraine for many years. The Ukraine has threatened to join NATO in a resolution vote, and Russia, concerned for its security, cannot allow Ukraine to join NATO. The purpose of NATO was to defend the United States against the Russian hordes during the Communist era, but there are no Russian hordes anymore and the Communist era and Soviet Union is over. Therefore, NATO has no reason to continually expand Eastward like it has done. If one is aware of the history leading up to this event, Russia's actions should come as no surprise.

Your situation is similar in some segments, but much much more dangerous because Ukraine is much bigger and with other side you have Superpower against you! Mr. Zelenskyy END the war that you cannot win militarily! End the agony of the Ukrainian people, Ukrainian children, Ukrainian soldiers! Several million more citizens, children, soldiers will die, but you cannot defeat the Russian military force! Russia can also lose hundreds of thousands of soldiers, but as you know, there is discipline in the Russian army, they know that if they deserted they will be shot!  Zelensky, sign everything Putin asks for! This is not the capitulation of the Ukrainian people (the Japanese signed the military capitulation, but the whole world knows that the Japanese people are brave) they signed to save the rest of the people! The number of victims is still as symbolic but could be much,much more higher!! STOP THE WAR!!

At this times it's really hard to tell who says the truth and who not (the western and Russian media tells the polar opposite, nobody has real proofs, many just say this or that happened but where are the proofs. I as German hope that this won't escalate even further we should go back to the table and speak about it Russia, Ukraine and the west should talk with each other and take each other's concerns seriously.

This action was admitted by Gorbachov only in 1990, and was exposed as a War Crime in the movie ""Enigma"" . The movie spells out the reason why

One day the people of all the countries that were ""regime changed"" will pay these countries back and the Cafe society socialism that did this will feel what its like to be a second class citizen in their own country, some are already getting there, getting poorer and poorer, what will they say or do to their government elites then?

And how were they suppose to be evacuated when they were one of the first ones targeted at the beginning of the war?  How much time passed from ""Russian warship, go f*** yourself"" to getting captured?

This guy was installed by the United States in a 2014 coup. Under his leadership, the people of eastern Ukraine have been continually bombed and shelled. The Azov battalion, a group of literal neo-nazis, are a significant part of this guy's military who has been bombing the people of eastern Ukraine for many years. The Ukraine has threatened to join NATO in a resolution vote, and Russia, concerned for its security, cannot allow Ukraine to join NATO. The purpose of NATO was to defend the United States against the Russian hordes during the Communist era, but there are no Russian hordes anymore and the Communist era and Soviet Union is over. Therefore, NATO has no reason to continually expand Eastward like it has done. If one is aware of the history leading up to this event, Russia's actions should come as no surprise.

I have a message for the Zelenskyy I am from Bosnia, I was a teenager when there was a war, Bosnians fought bravely for several years against Serbian aggression, in the end NATO - America helped end the war!Too Late for hundreds of thousands of killed civilians and soldiers, two million refugees, half of Bosnia destroyed! Your situation is similar in some segments, but much much more dangerous because Ukraine is much bigger and with other side you have Superpower against you! Mr. Zelenskyy END the war that you cannot win militarily! End the agony of the Ukrainian people, Ukrainian children, Ukrainian soldiers! Several million more citizens, children, soldiers will die, but you cannot defeat the Russian military force! Russia can also lose hundreds of thousands of soldiers, but as you know, there is discipline in the Russian army, they know that if they deserted they will be shot!  Zelensky, sign everything Putin asks for! This is not the capitulation of the Ukrainian people (the Japanese signed the military capitulation, but the whole world knows that the Japanese people are brave) they signed to save the rest of the people! The number of victims is still as symbolic but could be much,much more higher!! STOP THE WAR!!

None of this makes sense. There's only 2 soldiers on here saying anything negative of Ukraine, meaning these were the two Russia was able to coerce into propaganda videos. I don't understand how anyone was suppose to know of their condition until 2 days after they were captured, fog of war is a bitch like that.  So to say the lies were intentional is dishonest.  And how were they suppose to be evacuated when they were one of the first ones targeted at the beginning of the war?  How much time passed from ""Russian warship, go f*** yourself"" to getting captured?

Russia needs to hurry up and win this so the civilians and solders on both sides can go back to their families without anymore bloodshed. As for Ukraine, fighting this or prolonging it is futile. There's a saying, do you want short pain and survive to move on with your life or long pain that will last with no end in sight or worse? Cause seriously, this is Slavic vs Slavic, just like Chinese vs Taiwanese....they are both the same but with a different label of origin.
